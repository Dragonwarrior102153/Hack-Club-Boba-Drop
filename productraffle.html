                <h1>Our thanks to you</h1>
                <p>To show our gratitude to you, the sole reason of our existence, we have collaborated 
                with The Pokemon Company International to create our
                new unique Mega Pen Ex card that can only be obtained by buying our product. 
                This is only available for a limited time, and will be unobtainable after that.
                If you want this rare item, all you have to do is buy one of our product and we 
                will ship it to your front door!

                <p>The Pokemon Company International and we decided 
                    to hold a raffle, where the one lucky winner gets a collectors pen card for free! 
                    There will only be one of this card ever printed, making it extremely valuable. 
                    To enter the raffle, all you have to do is buy our product. Each of our product 
                    bought is one raffle ticket, so the more products you buy, the better your chance 
                    is to win the card.
